  Scan all artifacts produced before this phase. If this is defined the the scan will ignore files
  not produced by the current build. The "Regular expression for including files" and "Directory for 
  files to scan" work in parallel with this option. 
  <BR>
  Leave empty to let the build step scan ANY files it finds, not just artifacts produced by the 
  build.
