    Please specify the directory in the workspace you wish to scan. <br><br>
    If you wish to use an absolute path put '/' at the beginning of the path, this will cause
    the plugin to not try to find the folder from the build workspace. <i>Please notice that it is 
    possible to upload massive amounts of files if this option is set to absolute path and
    the 'Include subdirectories' is enabled.</i>
